            Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Yeah, lots of people did. Negative, bossy meat creature! Well, let's just dump it in the sewer and say we delivered it
            Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. If rubbin' frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, hey I don't wanna be right. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.
            Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Then throw her in the laundry room, which will hereafter be referred to as "the brig". Large bet on myself in round one. Actually, that's still true. I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan!
            That's not soon enough! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!
            Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Tell her she looks thin. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!
            Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. I had more, but you go ahead. Ask her how her day was. Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are dating humans!
